# Movies-ETL
## Background
What started off as a project for a hackathon to inspire staff has turned into a dataset with other possibilities.<br>
Amazing Prime, the platform for streaming movies and TV shows now wants to keep the dataset updated on a daily basis. Britta, needs your help to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. 
## Objective
The objective of this project was to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and perform the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
## Source files
- Wikipedia data
- Kaggle metadata
- Movielens rating data
## Deliverables
### Deliverable 1: Write an ETL Function to Read Three Data Files
The purpose of writing a function to read the three data files is to automate the ETL process and make sure that no one has to write all the code from scratch everytime. Writing a function to do this means that now we can do the work faster and efficiently.
The file for the code can be found at ![this link](https://github.com/lallben/Movies-ETL/blob/main/ETL_function_test.ipynb)
### Deliverable 2: Extract and Transform the Wikipedia Data
### Deliverable 3: Extract and Transform the Kaggle data
### Deliverable 4: Create the Movie Database
